// check-brief — conformance for `brief/`, per standards/BRIEF-STANDARD.md v1.1
//
// @kit check-brief v10 — tracked. Edit it in dev-standards and re-adopt; a local change
// here is a fork, and `check-kit-drift.mjs` will say so.
//
// Ten checks (B-1…B-10), one generator (--status), one probe (--selftest).
//
// WHY --selftest EXISTS AND RUNS IN THE GATE. CLAUDE-MD-STANDARD §4: a
// never-matching pattern reports zero violations, so tool failure and a clean
// tree are the same output. Every check below is therefore probed in BOTH
// directions against fixture trees — a planted violation must fail, and a
// known-good tree must pass. `check-gated-routes.mjs` established the shape.
//
// Usage:
//   node check-brief.mjs <projectDir>              run B-1…B-10
//   node check-brief.mjs <projectDir> --status     also rewrite brief/STATUS.md
//   node check-brief.mjs --selftest                probe both directions
//
// ABSENT SUBJECT → SKIPPED, NEVER PASSED. A check whose subject does not exist
// reports `skipped` and names what is missing; only B-1 fails on absence, because
// absence is B-1's subject. Found 2026-09-08 by Stéan: B-3 read "0 open gates, all
// complete" while GATES.md was a directory down, and B-4 still reads "0 rows" with
// no DECISIONS.md at all. Against a brief/ holding one file, FOUR checks were green.
// That is the check-spec-verification scar — a check satisfiable by deleting its
// subject — on this repo's own tooling. B-5 already had it right; the lesson was
// applied to one check and not the other seven.
//
// PRESENT BUT EMPTY IS STILL JUDGED. A GATES.md with a header and no rows is a
// project with no open gates, which is a legitimate pass. Only absence skips.
//
// Exit 0 = pass. Exit 1 = a check failed. Exit 2 = the tool could not run.

  // B-4 · THE DECISION LOG HAS BEEN SWEPT, AND NOTHING DEAD IS STILL IN IT.
  //
  // ── v2, 2026-09-10, and the old rule was UNSATISFIABLE. Three legs, reported by pleks. ──
  //
  // ① THE REMEDY MADE THE FILE BIGGER. pleks applied §2.4's own binding test to all 52 rows of a
  //   log over the threshold. Fifty-one still bound something in the tree — `009_security.sql`
  //   holds `get_rls_audit()` because of one row, `vercel.json` has no `crons` array because of
  //   another, a column is a `date` because of a third. Exactly one row was archivable. The file
  //   went 29,527 → 30,470 bytes. **Doing what the mandatory rule demanded made it breach harder.**
  //   (52 is the REPORTED count. Measured in the tree: 50 in the log + 1 archived = 51 — the
  //   Standing section was counted one high. The leg holds either way; BRIEF-STANDARD §2.4 says so.)
  //
  // ② §6 GUARANTEES THIS STATE ON DAY ONE. "Existing projects migrate by filing, not rewriting —
  //   no content is lost and no document is re-authored, which is the only kind of migration that
  //   reliably finishes." A migrating project therefore files its ENTIRE decision history in one
  //   act. The row count is a proxy for elapsed time — *enough history has accumulated that some of
  //   it has died* — and a seeded file arrives at full history with ZERO elapsed time. Nothing has
  //   died yet. This is not a young-repo edge case; it is the first-run state of every project that
  //   follows §6, and it is provable by reading §6 against §2.4 rather than by asserting anything
  //   about repos in general.
  //
  // ③ THE BYTE HALF CONTRADICTED §7, four lines from where this file restates §7. See the
  //   withdrawal note at ROTATE_BYTES.
  //
  // ── what it measures now, and why this is not diligence ─────────────────────────────────
  //
  // The rejected repair was "the threshold triggers a mandatory re-SWEEP, recorded". That is
  // satisfiable by sweeping, archiving nothing, writing that you archived nothing, and passing —
  // **it measures whether someone remembered, not what is true of the file**, which is the shape
  // this estate has now named in `audit.mjs`'s green tick meaning "I had no credentials" and in a
  // ✅ that means a box was pasted.
  //
  // So the trigger prompts a sweep and the VERDICT is about the file: **dead rows that are still
  // in it**. A log of 52 live rows is not a defect, it is 52 binding decisions, and archiving them
  // would destroy what the tree depends on. A log of 52 rows where 9 are dead is the failure the
  // rule was always for.
  //
  // THE SWEEP RECORD IS SELF-INVALIDATING against the file's own content, not against a calendar:
  // a sweep dated before the newest decision row cannot have covered it. No reviewer has to
  // remember a review date, and a record cannot rot quietly while rows are appended above it
  // (`unrun`'s obligation, taken from the file instead of from a promise).
  //
  // NOT BUILT, deliberately: splitting a genuinely unwieldy all-live log by band. It is the right
  // escalation — `build/INDEX.md` was split that way at 762 lines, on the argument that "band is
  // the only axis with no state transition to maintain: a row is born in `40-auth` and dies there",
  // and a decision row has that property. But no log in the estate is in that state, and a remedy
  // written for a condition nobody is in is a remedy nobody tests. §2.4 names it as the option.
  //
  // ── WHAT COUNTS AS A ROW, and what `N of M` means — both fixed before v5 shipped ──────────
  //
  // v5 as first written counted only rows whose first cell was a date. Run against pleks's own log,
  // the file this rule was rewritten for, it saw 33 rows: 32 dated decisions plus pleks's
  // sweep-record row, and none of the 19 rows in its two undated tables. So the sweep logic never
  // engaged on the file that motivated it — pleks passed as "under the trigger", which is the
  // scar-§6 shape: **a check satisfiable by deleting its subject**, where the subject is a date
  // cell. A row is now every body row of every table, and the date is used only for the sweep's
  // expiry — an undated row added after a sweep still invalidates it, through the count.
  //
  // And `N of M rows still bind` had to be read one way for the record to be satisfiable at all.
  // The first v5 required the log to hold M rows AND N === M, so the standard's own example —
  // `51 of 52` — could never pass: before archiving it fired "dead rows still in the log", after
  // archiving "the record describes a different file". **The standard taught a record the checker
  // rejects**, which is the template-marker scar again. M is what the sweep tested, N what still
  // bound, and after archival the log holds exactly N. That is the whole comparison.
