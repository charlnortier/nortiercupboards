/**
 * bash-gate.probe.mjs — KIT FILE, install at `.claude/hooks/`.
 *
 * @kit bash-gate-probe v9 — tracked OUTSIDE its `KIT:CONFIG` regions.
 *
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS, per `ledgers/LESSONS.md` L-01: a planted violation must FAIL
 * and a known-good case must PASS. A pattern that matches nothing reports 100%
 * clean; a pattern that matches everything reports 100% violation; and a
 * half-fixed pattern produces a plausible middle number, which is worse than
 * either. The gate is not trusted until both directions run.
 *
 * FOR THIS HOOK THE ALLOW CASES MATTER MORE THAN THE DENY CASES, which is the
 * reverse of the intuition. The posture is allow-by-default and the hook's
 * PURPOSE is to stop an unattended session stalling on `ls` — so a gate that
 * over-matches has failed at its job while looking maximally safe.
 *
 * v2 carries the decision table measured across four field copies on 2026-09-08.
 * Run this probe against a v1 hook and it goes red on every row v1 got wrong —
 * that output IS the adoption worklist. It resolves the hook from its own
 * location, so it can only ever exercise the file beside it.
 *
 * v5 (2026-09-10) adds the cases v4 could not hold: the protected branch reached BY REFERENCE, some
 * resolved from the command and some from fixture `.git/HEAD` files, and a force-push by `+refspec`
 * (yoros CF-3, CF-5). And one assertion against a witness the config did not write — the remote's
 * default branch — because every other case here derives from the value it would catch (CF-8).
 *
 * v6 (2026-09-11, yoros CF-4) asserts that every rule the hook holds carries a fallback, from the
 * list `bash-gate.js --fallbacks` prints — and holds that list to a witness it did not write: every
 * reason the hook gave in the cases below must belong to a rule on it, or the list is short a rule
 * and no count over it can see that rule. Whether a fallback is ANSWERED, and present in settings,
 * is `check-hook-registration`'s question; canon's own copy ships every one unfilled.
 *
 * v7 (2026-09-11) carries the payloads pleks and yoros measured v6 allowing (pleks CF-9, yoros
 * CF-10), and a DIFFERENTIAL run (pleks CF-10). This file's cases assert what the hook is meant to
 * do, so they cannot show what a replacement stopped doing. `--against <previous bash-gate.js>` puts
 * every case through the previous gate as well, and fails on any verdict that got LOOSER unless the
 * `LOOSENED` table below names it with a reason. Run it before you replace your gate, against the
 * copy you are replacing, so your own rules are in the comparison. v6's probe and pleks's corpus were
 * both green over a gate that allowed 15 payloads its predecessor refused.
 *
 * v8 (2026-09-11, yoros CF-11) adds the message cases: the mask must read `-am`, `-qm`, `-m"…"` and
 * `--message="…"`, and must not read `-Fm` or `-cm`, whose `m` is another flag's value. And three
 * payloads every earlier version allowed — `$(…)` and backticks in a double-quoted message, and a
 * `-m` inside quotes. `LOOSENED` now accumulates across versions: an adopter at v6 runs `--against`
 * its v6, and a table describing only v7→v8 would have called v7's declared loosenings undeclared.
 *
 * Run: node .claude/hooks/bash-gate.probe.mjs   (wire into the `probe` script)
 *      node .claude/hooks/bash-gate.probe.mjs --against <the gate you are replacing>

/**
 * A PROJECT MAY BE STRICTER THAN CANON, AND UNTIL 2026-09-09 THAT MADE THIS ROW UNSHIPPABLE.
 *
 * Reported by the life-therapy session: 7 of 65 probes failed against a CORRECTLY adopted
 * bash-gate v2, and every failure was the project being tighter — it asks on every push where
 * canon allows on a non-protected branch, and denies `git reset --hard` where canon asks.
 *
 *   ✗ want allow got ask   pushing <working-branch> is not the deployment
 *   ✗ want allow got ask   --force-with-lease is the SAFE form and must not be denied
 *   ✗ want ask   got deny  hard reset discards uncommitted work with no undo
 *
 * The probe had a `cases` region for rules a project ADDS and none for verdicts it TIGHTENS, so
 * canon's push and reset policy sat in the file as if it were a canon invariant. It is not: a
 * project's own gate policy is precisely what the hook's config regions exist to vary. And the
 * MANIFEST says the probe ships WITH the gate or the gate does not ship — so the row could not be
 * adopted by anyone stricter than canon, which is the direction you would never want to punish.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. An override may only make a verdict STRICTER
 * (allow → ask → deny). Loosening one below canon's still fails, and so does naming a `why` that
 * no case carries — the first would be a project quietly switching off a control canon ships, and
 * the second is a rule that stopped applying without anyone noticing. A project may say "we are
