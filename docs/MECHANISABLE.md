# MECHANISABLE — the mechanisation build queue

Rules in `CLAUDE.md` marked UNENFORCEABLE — MECHANISABLE carry a pointer `M-0NN` to an entry here,
which holds the sketch of what a mechanism would assert. **It only shrinks**: an entry leaves when
its mechanism ships and the rule in `CLAUDE.md` gets an `@enforced` tag instead of the pointer.
No speculative entries outside a triage pass. No entry count here — count with
`grep -cE '^### M-[0-9]+'`.

Entry grammar:

```md
### M-0NN · <the rule, as CLAUDE.md states it>
- **Rung:** hook | check | eslint · **Blast:** <what a violation costs>
- **Would assert:** <the observable condition, and its planted-violation probe>
```

## Open

### M-001 · Every email send on a request path is awaited or inside `after()`
- **Rung:** check · **Blast:** a lost lead; it happened twice (2026-10-02, 2026-10-04)
- **Would assert:** no call to `sendEmail(`, `notifyAdmin(` or `sendRawEmail(` in `app/` or `lib/`
  appears as a bare statement (not `await`ed, not returned, not inside an `after(` callback).
  Planted violation: the pre-fix `git show 47b597b^:lib/contact/actions.ts` must fail it.

### M-002 · Every `"use server"` export that uses `createAdminClient` checks the caller
- **Rung:** check · **Blast:** an anonymous service-role write; `lib/storage.ts` shipped one
  (fixed 2026-10-05)
- **Would assert:** each exported function in a `"use server"` file that reaches
  `createAdminClient` calls `ensureAdmin`/`requireAdmin`/`getUser`, or is listed in an allowlist
  with its reason (the contact form and password reset are public by design). Planted violation:
  `5d8c906^:lib/storage.ts`.
